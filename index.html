    <h1>hi...i'm jonasz</h1>

    <p>
        I'm currently a student at <a href="https://www.makeschool.com/" target="_blank">Make School</a> in San Francisco, where I study data science. Before going to college, I spent a lot of time exploring what I wanted to do. I got started programming in high school with the quite strange Objectice-C. It helped prepare me for an internship at a <a href="http://www.ispot.com/" target="_blank">local software company</a>. After an enriching summer in Walnut Creek, I realized that I might just want to be a software engineer.

        After the internship, I spent my last two years of high school engulfed by a series of web-based projects. One of them used Reddit's ranking algorithm to curate video content from other websites. By the time I graduated, I had a small portfolio of work that landed me an Android contracting job for a <a href="https://caura.org/">non-profit in Berkeley</a>.

        After doing a little mobile work, I wanted to see what else was out there. While dropping in on classes my community college, I did some development work <a href="http://vsolvit.com/" target="_blank">VSolvit</a>. Most of my work consisted of automated testing and Python scripting.
